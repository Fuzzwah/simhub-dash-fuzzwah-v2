# Fuzzwah v2 Dash for SimHub

This is my custom made SimHub dashboard specifically created to work with the cars I race on the iRacing service.

The content shown in the left hand panel changes depending on the car you're driving. For example, below is a screenshot of what it looks like when driving the Formula Renault 3.5:
