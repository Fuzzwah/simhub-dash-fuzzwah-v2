# Fuzzwah v2 Dash for SimHub

This is my custom made SimHub dashboard specifically created to work with the cars I race on the iRacing service.

The content shown in the left hand panel changes depending on the car you're driving. For example, below is a screenshot of what it looks like when driving a GT3 car:

For a GTE, since it doesn't have ABS, the slot in the top right of the left panel displays the TC2 setting.

Cars that I've created custom left hand panels for are:

* McLaren MP4-12C GT3
* Audi R8 LMS
* BMW Z4 GT3
* Ferrari 488 GT3
* Ford GT GT3
* Mercedes AMG GT3
* Ferrari 488 GTE
* Porsche 911 RSR
* Ford GT - 2017
* BMW M8 GTE
* Holden Commodore VF V8
* Ford Falcon FG V8
* Williams-Toyota FW31
* Dallara IR18
* Porsche 919
* Formula Renault 3.5

For all other cars, a simplified left hand panel is displayed instead:
